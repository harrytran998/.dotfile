1. List all nearby WIFI networks

```bash
nmcli device wifi list

When you see something like this

        84:D8:YY:29:XX:C8  WifiNameA      Infra  2     270 Mbit/s  70      ▂▄▆_  WPA2
        84:D8:YY:ZZ:XX:C7  WifiNameB      Infra  149   135 Mbit/s  50      ▂▄__  WPA2

2. Connect to the wifi you knew

```
nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password password
```

In this example --> `nmcli device wifi connect WifiNameA password my-password`

3. If connect success, you will see
